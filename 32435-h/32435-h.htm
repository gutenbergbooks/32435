<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />
<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Damas.</i> * * * The Prince of Como does not</p>
<p class="i5">understand his own language.</p>
<p><i>Melnotte.</i> Not as you pronounce it: Who the</p>
<p class="i5">deuce could?</p>
</div></div>
<hr class="hr2" />

<p>It may be regarded as one of the commendable
peculiarities of the English language that, despite
provincialisms, vulgarisms, neglected education, foreign
accent, and the various corrupting influences to
which it is subjected, it may be understood wherever
it is heard, whatever differences of distance or
associations may have existed between the speaker
and the listener, both claiming familiarity with it.
Considering these influences and the arbitrariness of
the orthoepical rules of the language, there has been
expressed surprise that frequent degenerations into
uncouth dialects or patois have not occurred. A
decent regard for the common weal should cause
gratification that such degenerations have not taken
place, for were it not for the ability of our tongue
to preserve its individuality against the tendency
toward corruption, we might reasonably fear such a
Babel-like confusion, that, when asked, "Do you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
speak English?" one might appropriately, <i>sans</i> the
profanity, reply in the language of the text, "Not
as you pronounce it: Who the deuce could?" While
the majority of people place no other value upon
language than that of convenience, and are indifferent
to any corruption, so long as they can simply
understand and be understood, there is happily a
better class, the æsthetic cultivation of which is such
that those who belong to it are anxious to preserve
the purity of our vernacular and are ashamed of all
errors of speech in their daily conversations. For
such it will not be uninteresting to look over a number
of errors, principally of pronunciation, that are
not formally laid down as such in books, and which
people, even many of the best educated, are constantly
committing, just because they have never had
their attention called to them. These errors are becoming
more deeply rooted every day and if not
soon eradicated, it will not be many years before our
orthoepic standard will be overthrown as it was in
England some years ago.</p>

<p>Smart, one of the most celebrated of English orthoepists,
in the preface of his dictionary says: "The
proprietors of Walker's dictionary, finding it would
slide entirely out of use unless it were adapted to
the present day, engaged me as a teacher of elocution,
known in London since Walker's time, to make
the necessary changes." A standard pronouncing
dictionary is a work that involves an extraordinary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
amount of labor and research in its compilation,
and exerts an influence almost autocratical. The
possibility of its becoming worthless in a short time
is strange, especially when it is not on account of
any work claiming superiority, but merely because
error long persisted in finally becomes more authoritative
than the original exemplar. With little effort,
however, we can discern the causes. Persons are apt
to acquire the pronunciation and use of the greater
number of words by imitation, rather than by study.
With confidence in the knowledge of the parent,
teacher, minister, physician and others, their examples
are followed without ever considering that they
are often very fallible guides.</p>

<p>A complete dictionary is an immense volume, and
to turn over its pages with even a casual observation
of each word, requires an amount of time that few
would feel like devoting to it; and yet this is the
only way in which a person can become <i>assured</i> of
the sanctioned pronunciation and meaning of a great
many words. If they would make it an invariable
rule to make memoranda of all the words they read
or hear spoken, about the orthoepy and import of
which they are not absolutely certain, and at their
first leisure opportunity would consult their chosen
authority, it would not be long before the majority
of errors would be corrected; but this requires memory,
inclination, time, continuity of purpose, possession
of dictionaries or access to them&mdash;circumstances
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
that are seldom found combined. It will doubtless
be useless to rehearse any of the arguments commonly
employed to prove the necessity of having
some sovereign standard, to the guidance of which we
must be willing to submit. Those for whom this
work is intended will be willing to admit that. Nor
is it necessary to assert that as far as the English
speakers of the United States are interested, the only
works that lay claim to such a position are the dictionaries
of Webster and Worcester. If the right
of the opinions of the majority of scholars throughout
the land were alone considered, the former would
certainly be entitled to the preference; but the work
of the latter is too full of merit and has too many
adherents in the ranks of the educated to permit
any one to say that it is not worthy of high esteem.</p>

<p>With my own preference for the former and with
my willingness to acknowledge the worth of the latter,
I have consulted both authorities concerning
every word in the following vocabulary&mdash;that is,
every word requiring reference to either. It will be
seen that there is much less difference between the
decisions of the two dictionaries than is commonly
supposed. By this reference to each, I have not only
corrected errors in an impartial manner, but have also
stopped up that loop-hole through which so many try
to escape by saying, when they are called to account
according to one dictionary, that they do not accept
that as their standard. As far as the people of this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
country are concerned, there is no escape from the
conclusion that a person is considered a correct or
an incorrect speaker of English, according to whether
or not he conforms his discourse to one of the above
mentioned authorities. At first glance it will appear
that the size of this volume is not at all commensurate
to the task of correcting the many errors that
are heard in our communication with all classes that
pretend to speak the English language. It is not
intended to instruct those whose education has been
so neglected that they are guilty of the grossest violation
of syntax and orthoepy, nor to cultivate the
taste of those whose selection of words and cant and
slang phrases betrays the low grade of the associations
by which they have been surrounded. It is
designed rather as a collection of the more common
of those errors, chiefly orthoepical, that I have before
spoken of as being of constant occurrence even
among people of education, unless they have paid
considerable attention to philology or <i>belles-lettres</i>.
If by presenting them in this convenient form, thus
saving much time and trouble in referring to the
dictionary, I have merited the thanks of my readers,
or if I have contributed even a mite toward the conservation
of the present usage, I shall feel amply
repaid.</p>

<p>I have taken advantage of the alphabetical arrangement
to introduce a few miscellaneous errors that
might have been placed under a separate heading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
    Instead of dividing the words into syllables and
loading them with marks as is usually done in dictionaries,
I have thought that it would make a deeper
impression on the memory to present the words
as they are commonly seen in print, depending on
respelling to furnish the correct and incorrect accent
and pronunciation.</p>

<p>The corrections have first been made according to
Webster; if Worcester is unmentioned, it is to be
understood that both authorities agree.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Acclimate</b>&mdash;ak-kl&#299;´m&#257;te, not ak´kli-m&#257;te.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Acclimated</b> is also accented on the second syllable.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Acclimatization</b>&mdash;ak-kli-mat-i-z&#257;´shun, not

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Aerated</b>&mdash;&#257;´er-&#257;-ted, not &#257;´r&#275;-&#257;-ted.
"<i>Areated bread</i>" is a mistake that is frequently
made.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Ailantus</b>&mdash;&#257;-l&#259;n´t&#365;s, not &#257;-l&#259;n´th&#365;s;
&#259;t-l&#259;n´tus is a still worse error.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Albumen</b>&mdash;al-b&#363;´men, not al´bu-men.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Alder</b>&mdash;awl´der, not &#259;l´der;
it is the name of a <i>tree</i> and
does not mean the ordinary <i>elder</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Alike.</b> It is sufficient to say
that two persons or things
are <i>alike</i>, not <i>both alike</i>.
The word associated with
<i>alike</i> is just as unnecessary
as it is with <i>resemble</i> and
<i>equal</i> in the following sentences:
"These two men
<i>both</i> resemble each other."
"These two sums are <i>both</i>
equal."</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Allopathy</b>&mdash;al-l&#335;p´a-thy, not
al´lo-path-y.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Allopathist</b> is similarly accented.</p>

<i>among</i> many and <i>between</i>
two.</p>

nor &#257;´m&#333;&#333;r.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Angry.</b> Say angry <i>with</i> a person
and <i>at</i> a thing.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Animalcula</b> is the plural of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<i>animalculum</i>; there is no
such word as <i>animalcul&oelig;</i>.
Animalcule (singular) and
animalcules (plural), are
proper words; the former
is pronounced an-i-mal´k&#363;le
and the latter an-i-mal´k&#363;lz.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Antarctic</b>&mdash;ant-ärk´tik, not
ant-är´tik.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Apex</b>&mdash;&#257;´pex, not &#259;p´ex.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Apparatus</b>&mdash;ap-pa-r&#257;´tus, not
ap-pa-r&#259;t´us.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Aquaria</b>, not <i>aquariums</i>, is
the plural of <i>aquarium</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Arabic</b>&mdash;&#259;r´a-b&#301;k, not a-r&#259;b´&#301;k,
a-r&#257;´b&#301;k, nor &#259;r´a-b&#259;k;
which errors are very common,
especially in the compound
word <i>gum-arabic</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Arbitrary</b> is often incorrectly
pronounced as if spelled
<i>ar-bi-ta-ry</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Archangel</b>&mdash;ärk-&#257;n´jel, not

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Aroma</b>&mdash;a-r&#333;´ma, not &#259;r´o-ma.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>At</b> should not be used when
it has no possible connection
with the other words
of a sentence; as, "Where
are you living <i>at</i>?"</p>

<b>aye</b>, an affirmative vote,
are pronounced ä&#301; and not
&#299; nor &#257;.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Aye</b>, meaning forever, always
(used chiefly in poetry),
is pronounced &#257; not
&#299; nor ä&#301;.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Bade</b>&mdash;b&#259;d, not b&#257;de.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Badinage</b>&mdash;b&#259;d´in-äzh, not
b&#259;d´in-&#257;je. Worcester gives
the same pronunciation,
but places the accent on

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Balance.</b> There are two
common errors connected
with this word. One is to
write it <i>ballance</i>: the other
is to use it in the sense of
<i>remainder</i>, <i>rest</i>, etc.; as, the
<i>balance</i> of the day, the <i>balance</i>
of the people. Balance
means properly "the
excess on one side, or what
added to the other makes
equality." The corrupt use
of the word, as above mentioned,
is laid down as a
vulgarism.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Brand-new</b>, not <i>bran-new</i>.
Although the latter adjective
is much used, it is evidently
a corruption of the
former. An article in its
newness may be bright like
a <i>brand</i> of fire, or the <i>brand</i>
of the manufacturer may
remain intact, but there is
certainly no <i>bran</i> about it.</p>

finest cut, with its faces and
facets so arranged as to secure
the greatest degree
of brilliancy&mdash;whence the
name. The name to many
conveys the idea of paste,

may be just as pure,

it to be made a <i>brilliant</i>
of without a much greater
loss of substance.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Calculate</b> is often inappropriately
used in lieu of <i>believe</i>,
<i>suppose</i>, <i>expect</i>, etc., as
in the following sentences:
"I <i>calculate</i> you are my
friend;" "I <i>calculate</i> the
report is true." Still worse
than this passive misuse
is that active one of using
the word in some such
sense as this: "Doctor, I
know that you are a man
of great intelligence and I
have unlimited confidence
in your honor and ability;
but I must say that I think
the course of treatment
pursued by you during this
epidemic, is <i>calculated</i> to increase
the mortality among
your patients." How inconsistent
with the encomium
is the dreadful accusation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
just following!
As if the Doctor had sat
down and <i>calculated</i> how
he could cause injury rather
than benefit. Calculate
means to ascertain by
means of figures or to
study what means must be
used to secure a certain
result. A person may
make a speech, write a
book, or do anything else
<i>calculated</i> to do good, or
more rarely, evil, but the
intention to accomplish
the object spoken of must
be present, before the word
can be properly used.</p>

Not down, thus
compounded in Webster,
but his pronunciation of
the separate words is as
given. Worcester gives
the word as above and defines
it as an adjective&mdash;diagonal.
It is generally
used though, I believe, as
an adverb; as, "the piano
stands cater-cornered" (diagonally).
It is regarded as
an inelegant word, diagonal
and diagonally being
preferred: though it is
probable that this opinion
has been caused by the
abominable pronunciations
<i>catty</i> and <i>kitty</i> cornered.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Catalpa</b>&mdash;ka-t&#259;l´pa, not ka-tawl´pa.</p>

quite vulgar.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Chid</b>, not ch&#299;´ded, is the imperfect

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Chivalrous</b>&mdash;sh&#301;v´al-r&#365;s, not

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Chivalry</b>&mdash;sh&#301;v´al-ry, not

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Citrate</b>&mdash;s&#301;t´rate, not s&#299;´trate.
"Citrate of magnesia."</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Climbed</b>, not clomb (klum).

climb <i>down</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Cochineal</b>&mdash;k&#335;ch´i-neel, not
k&#333;´chi-neel nor k&#333;´ki-neel.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Cocoa</b> (k&#333;´k&#333;) is not made
from the cocoa-nut or tree,
but from the seeds of the
<i>cacao</i> (ka-k&#257;´o) or chocolate
tree. The word is evidently
a perversion, but it
has gained a permanent
footing in its present signification.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Cognomen</b>&mdash;k&#335;g-no´men,
not k&#335;g´no-men.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Cold-chisel</b>, not <i>coal-chisel</i>.
It is a chisel of peculiar
strength and hardness for
cutting <i>cold</i> metal.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Cole-slaw.</b> In the former
editions of some dictionaries
it has been taught
that this word is derived
from <i>cole</i> meaning cabbage,
and <i>slaw</i> meaning salad.
Cole-slaw&mdash;cabbage-salad.
The uninstructed soon
changed the <i>cole</i> into <i>cold</i>
and substituted <i>hot</i> for the
other extreme of temperature,
thus entirely changing
the signification. What
was really meant, was <i>hot
cole-slaw</i> and <i>cold cole-slaw</i>.
Many persons still regard
<i>cole-slaw</i> as the proper
word, and receipt books
give that orthography. The
last editions of Webster and
Worcester, however, only
give the words <i>cole</i> and
<i>slaw</i> in separate places and
define the latter as "sliced
cabbage."</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Combatant</b>&mdash;k&#335;m´bat-ant,

not kom-b&#259;t´ive-ness.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Come</b> is often thoughtlessly
used for <i>go</i> or some other
word. If How is just leaving
Howard's house it is
right for How to say, "I'll
come to see you soon," but
Howard could not properly
say, <i>at that place</i>, the
same thing. He should
say, "I will go to see you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
soon." If they both live in
Philadelphia and should
meet in New York, neither
could say appropriately,
"I'll come to see you after
I get home;" that would
mean that one would travel
back from his home in
Philadelphia to New York
to see the other. But either
might say, "Come and
see me when you get
home."</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Comparable</b>&mdash;k&#335;m´pa-ra-ble,

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Complaisance</b>&mdash;k&#335;m´pla-zans,
not k&#335;m-pl&#257;´z&#259;ns. In
complaisant and complaisantly,
the accent is also on
the first syllable. Worcester
places it on the third,
thus: complaisant (kom-pla-z&#259;nt´),
etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Comptroller</b>&mdash;kon-tr&#333;l´ler,

A pipe or canal for the
conveyance of fluid.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Confab</b>, not <i>conflab</i>. A contraction
of confabulation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Congeries</b>&mdash;k&#335;n-j&#275;´r&#301;-eez,

A collection of particles
into one mass.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Contemptuous</b>, not <b>contemptible</b>,
when the manifestation
of contempt for
another is meant. I once
heard a young lady describing
how she had withered
at a glance a poor
young man that had incurred
her displeasure. "O,
I gave him such a <i>contemptible</i>
look," said she. If
in the enthusiasm of the
rehearsal, the look that
dwelt upon her features
was akin to that given upon
the occasion mentioned,
no auditor doubted the exact
truth of what she said;
but she meant differently.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Contiguous</b>&mdash;kon-tig´&#363;-&#365;s,

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Contour</b>&mdash;k&#335;n-t&#333;&#333;r´, not

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Contra-dance</b> is better than
<i>country-dance</i>, the latter
word being a corruption;

other.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Contrary</b>&mdash;k&#335;n´tra-ry, not

Worcester allows the
latter.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Depot</b>&mdash;de-p&#333;´ or d&#275;´p&#333;, not
d&#257;´p&#333;, nor d&#277;p´po. Worcester
sanctions de-p&#333;´

deceased now, of course,
who called it de-p&#335;t´.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Dereliction</b>&mdash;der-e-l&#301;k´shun,

<b>Dishabille</b>&mdash;d&#301;s-a-b&#301;l´, } not
d&#277;s´ha-beel nor d&#301;s´ha-beel.
The French is déshabillé,
pronounced about
like d&#257;-zä-be-y&#257;, without
any particular accent.
Some persons, in their vain
efforts to get the peculiar
liquid sound of the double
l, sometimes used, distort
the word terribly, pronouncing
it even as broad
as d&#301;s-ha-beel´yuh.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Desideratum</b>&mdash;de-sid-e-r&#257;´tum,
not de-s&#301;d-er-&#259;t´um;

Something particularly desired.</p>

d&#333;´lor-o&#365;s. <b>Dolorously</b>
and <b>Dolorousness</b> are
similarly accented; but
<b>dolor</b> is pronounced d&#333;´lor.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Doubt.</b> "I do not doubt
but that it is so," is a very
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
common error. The meaning
conveyed is just the
opposite to that which the
speaker intends. He declares
in other words, that
he has <i>no</i> doubt <i>but</i> a doubt
that it is so; or he does not
doubt that it is false. "I
have no doubt but," and
"there is no doubt but,"&mdash;are
similar mistakes. The
word "but" should be left
out.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Dough-face</b> means one that
is easily molded to one's

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Excrescence</b>&mdash;ex-kr&#277;s´sense
not ex-kr&#275;´sense. A superfluous
appendage: morbid
outgrowth.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Expect</b> has reference to the
future only, and not to the
present or past. "I <i>expect</i>
that you are wrong." "I
<i>expect</i> you were disappointed
yesterday," are
errors. There is an abundance
of words that may be
correctly used, as <i>suppose</i>,
<i>suspect</i>, <i>imagine</i>, <i>believe</i> and

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Forceps</b>&mdash;fôr´seps, not f&#333;r´seps.
The word is spelled
the same in both the singular
and the plural numbers.
Such mistakes as,
"hand me a forcep," instead
of "hand me a
forceps," are very common.
Strictly speaking,
"a pair of forceps," ought,
I suppose, to mean <i>two</i> forceps;
but like the expressions
"a pair of scissors"
and "a pair of stairs," the
phrase has been in use so
long that it must be tolerated.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Forehead</b>&mdash;f&#335;r´ed, not f&#333;r´h&#277;d.
Worcester allows

to use, if used at all, when
the embryo whiskers, or
the downy surface of fruit,
etc., are meant. Down is
the more appropriate
word. <i>Furze</i> is the name
of an evergreen shrub.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Gallivating</b>, not <i>gallivanting</i>.
Gallivanting is a word that
is used to some extent, being
applied to persons that
are roaming about for
amusement or adventure;
as, "this young man has
been <i>gallivanting</i> around."
If it is a corruption of <i>gallanting</i>,
it should certainly
be abolished as a vulgarism;
but if it is a corruption
of <i>gallivating</i>, from
<i>gallivat</i>, the name of a
small sailing vessel, it
might be clothed in its
proper garb and retained
as a useful word in our
language. If either is used,
the one above preferred
should be chosen, at any
rate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Gallows</b>&mdash;g&#259;l´lus, not g&#259;l´l&#333;z.

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Got.</b> There are some sticklers
for niceties that overdo
themselves in contending
that the use of the verb
<i>got</i> is generally unnecessary
and incorrect in conjunction
with <i>have</i> and <i>had</i>.
Get means to procure, to
obtain, to come into possession
of, etc., and it is a
very tame assertion that
one simply <i>has</i> a thing
that cost much mental or
physical labor. A scholar
<i>has</i> his lesson, but did it
creep into his head while
he passively shut his eyes
and went to sleep? On the
contrary, he <i>got</i> it or
learned it by hard study,
and it is proper to say that
he has <i>got</i> it. A man <i>has</i>
a cold, but he <i>got</i> it or <i>took</i>
it by exposing himself. A
person <i>has</i> a sum of money,
but he <i>got</i> or <i>earned</i> it by
his labor. Another <i>has</i>
good friends, but he <i>got</i> or
<i>secured</i> them by his pleasant
address. The great
causes of the warfare
against this word are, I
think, that <i>have</i> and <i>had</i>,
though generally used as
auxiliaries, can sometimes
be used as principal verbs
and make good sense; and
that it has not been recollected
that in the majority
of cases <i>got</i> either stands
for, or can be substituted
for another verb. In confirmation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of this last statement,
is appended the following
composed by Dr.
Withers: "I <i>got</i> on horseback
within ten minutes
after I <i>got</i> your letter.
When I <i>got</i> to Canterbury,
I <i>got</i> a chaise for town, but
I <i>got</i> wet before I <i>got</i> to
Canterbury; and I have
<i>got</i> such a cold as I shall
not be able to <i>get</i> rid of in
a hurry. I <i>got</i> to the Treasury
about noon, but first of
all I <i>got</i> shaved and dressed.
I soon <i>got</i> into the secret
of getting a memorial
before the board, but I
could not <i>get</i> an answer
then; however, I <i>got</i> intelligence
from the messenger,
that I should most likely
<i>get</i> one the next morning.
As soon as I <i>got</i> back
to my inn, I <i>got</i> my supper
and <i>got</i> to bed. It was not
long before I <i>got</i> asleep.
When I <i>got</i> up in the
morning, I <i>got</i> my breakfast,
and then I <i>got</i> myself
dressed that I might <i>get</i>
out in time to <i>get</i> an answer
to my memorial. As
soon as I <i>got</i> it, I <i>got</i> into
the chaise and <i>got</i> to Canterbury
by three, and about
tea-time, I got home. I
have <i>got</i> nothing for you,
and so adieu."</p>

<p class="indent">Applying this test of
substitution to any doubtful
case, I think it right to
assert that if there is no
other verb, or participle,
that will appropriately
take the place of "got,"
the latter word is <i>unnecessary</i>;
but it should hardly
be considered as an error,
as it is so slight an impropriety
compared with
many others that are allowed,
and especially because
we have long had the
usage of many of the best
writers to sanction the employment
of the word. The
very people that appear to
be so shocked at the use of
the superfluous <i>got</i>, may
generally be heard making
use of such expressions
as "fell <i>down</i> upon the
ground," "rose <i>up</i> and
went away," "covered it
<i>over</i>," and "a great, <i>big</i>
fire." The <i>down</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>over</i>
and <i>big</i> are certainly superfluities,
but they have
been heard so long that
they are seldom mentioned
as errors.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Lay</b>. This word in the sense
here considered is a transitive
verb, or one in which
the action or state implied
by the verb, passes over to
an object. The present
tense is <i>lay</i>; the imperfect
tense and past participle
are <i>laid</i>; and the present
participle <i>laying</i>. Requiring
an object in each of
the various meanings attached
to it, it is proper to
say: "The hen <i>lays</i> an egg
every day;" "The man <i>laid</i>
his load on the ground;"
"The rain has <i>laid</i> the
dust;" "The hunter is <i>laying</i>
a snare." The verb <i>lie</i>
is an <i>intransitive</i> verb and
can have <i>no object</i> after it.
The present tense is <i>lie</i>; the
imperfect tense is <i>lay</i>; the
past participle is <i>lain</i>; the
present participle is <i>lying</i>.
Having no objective case
to which the action or state
passes over, it is correct to
say: "Ohio <i>lies</i> north of
Kentucky;" "The sick
man <i>lay</i> upon the bed yesterday;"
"He has <i>lain</i>
there helpless for weeks;"
"The goods I bought are
<i>lying</i> on my hands." Contrasting
the sentences under
each verb it will be
readily seen that Ohio does
not <i>lie</i> Kentucky, but the
hen <i>lays</i> the egg; the invalid
did not <i>lay</i> the bed like
the man <i>laid</i> his load; he
has not <i>lain</i> anything, as
the rain has <i>laid</i> the dust;
and the goods are not <i>lying</i>
anything, as the hunter is
<i>laying</i> the snare. If the
foregoing differences have
been carefully observed, I
imagine that it will always
be easy to select the proper
word by remembering
the following rules:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. If the person or thing

<p class="indent">"He <i>laid</i> upon the bed,"
then, is incorrect, for the
verb has no object. It
should be: "He <i>lay</i> upon
the bed." But, "He <i>laid</i>
<i>himself</i> upon the bed,"
would be correct, for there
is an objective case, <i>himself</i>,
supplied. "Let these papers
<i>lay</i>," should be, "Let
these papers <i>lie</i>." "The
ship <i>lays</i> at anchor," should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
be, "The ship <i>lies</i> at anchor."
"The ship <i>laid</i> at
anchor," should be, "The
ship <i>lay</i> at anchor." "They
have <i>laid</i> in wait for you,"
should be, "They have
<i>lain</i> in wait for you." "This
trunk is <i>laying</i> in our way,"
should be, "This trunk is
<i>lying</i> in our way." Errors
connected with the use of
these verbs are more common,
probably, than any
others in our language,
being detected in the conversation
and writings of
many of the best educated
people. Attention to the
above rules, and a few trial
sentences in the different
moods, tenses, numbers
and persons, ought to make
the selection of the proper
word so simple, that persons
should seldom make
mistakes.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Learn.</b> <i>Learning</i> is done by
the scholar or student, and
<i>teaching</i> by the instructor.
"She will <i>learn</i> me how to
play," should be, "She
will <i>teach</i> me how to play,"
etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Leasing</b>&mdash;leez´ing, not l&#275;s´ing.
An obsolete word
meaning falsehood; lying.
"Thou shalt destroy them
that speak leasing."&mdash;<i>Bible.</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Leg.</b> Of late years there
has become quite popular
a prudish notion that it is
indelicate to say <i>leg</i> when
one of the limbs that supports
the human body is
meant, <i>limb</i> being preferred
instead. <i>Leg</i> is certainly
a less euphonious
word than <i>limb</i>, and if the
latter had the same signification
attached to it,
there would be no objection
to its employment;
but <i>limb</i> means <i>arm</i> just as
much as it does <i>leg</i>. There
is nothing immodest in the
sound or meaning of the
word <i>leg</i>; if there were, it
would be well to speak of
the <i>limb</i> of a table, a <i>limb</i>
of mutton, or a three
<i>limbed</i> stool; and the mention
of such words as <i>legacy</i>
or <i>legate</i> should cause
the blush to rise to our
cheeks. The very use of
the word <i>limb</i> indicates
what is passing in the mind
of the speaker&mdash;a thought
of <i>leg</i>, an indelicate meaning
attached to it, and a
fear to speak the word.
The mind of the listener
is affected similarly and
the result is that a conversation
intended to be perfectly
pure, has a slight
stain left upon it. If we
could pass through life
without ever finding it necessary
to speak of our legs
to strangers, there would
be no danger of compromising
ourselves; but run-away
and other accidents
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
are constantly occurring in
which legs are broken or
otherwise injured. When
a surgeon is called, if he is
told that a <i>limb</i> is injured,
he has one chance in four
of guessing the riddle. It
is not always safe to trifle
thus with some of the serious,
practical old followers
of Esculapius. Before
now they have given such
rebukes as to make people
ashamed that they did not
say <i>leg</i> in the first place;
or they have left the bedside
abruptly with such a
remark as: "When you
find out whether it is your
arm or your leg, send for
me again." If people will
persist in using <i>limb</i> for
<i>leg</i>, it is to be hoped that
they will adopt some adjective
prefix to remove all
ambiguity. How would
north-east, south-east, etc.,
do? Any one informed
that the <i>south-east limb</i> was
fractured, would know at
once that it was the <i>right</i>
<i>leg</i>.</p>

to vary or inflect in a musical

I was once in a portion of

frequently heard such remarks

"<i>These</i> molasses are very
good; <i>they</i> are the best I

I once began to remonstrate
with one of the

insisted that he should
say, "<i>this</i> molasses" and,
"<i>it</i> is good," etc.; but it
was of no avail. He insisted
that the word was
analogous to <i>ashes</i>, and if
one was plural so was the
other. There was no good

when that portion of a
piano or harp that is acted

P&#275;´dal is an adjective, and
means pertaining to the

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Perfect.</b> I have selected
this as the representative
of a class of adjectives that,
strictly speaking, do not
admit of comparison. I
have noticed, invariably,
that those who appear to
be so anxious to correct
the error of giving degrees
of comparison to a few
stereotyped words of this
class, such as <i>round</i>, <i>square</i>,
<i>universal</i>, <i>chief</i>, <i>extreme</i>, etc.,
are singularly remiss in
calling attention to a great
many other mistakes of the
same kind that are equally
prominent. Amongst the
latter may be mentioned
the comparison of <i>correct</i>,
<i>complete</i>, <i>even</i>, <i>level</i>, <i>straight</i>,
etc. It will be admitted
that if anything is <i>perfect</i>
it can not be <i>more</i> so; and
as soon as it is <i>less</i> so it fails
to be <i>perfect</i> at all. So, if
anything is <i>correct</i> it is
perfectly free from error;
it can not be made <i>more</i>
correct, and if its correctness
is detracted from, it
is not quite correct any
longer. A <i>straight</i> line is
one that does not vary from
a perfectly <i>direct</i> course in
the slightest degree; it can
not be <i>straighter</i> and if it
could be <i>less</i> straight, it
would be <i>curved</i>. It is ridiculous
for any one to insist
upon a national reformation
of a few such errors,
and suffer a hundred
others just like them to exist
without remonstrance.
Either <i>nearer</i> and <i>nearest</i>,
<i>more nearly</i>, and <i>most nearly</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and the like, should be
substituted for the degrees
of comparison and used
with all such words; or
people should treat them
as all other adjectives, just
as the best writers and
speakers have always done.
The former course is the
more desirable; the latter
is certainly the more probable.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Perfidious</b>&mdash;per-f&#301;d´i-ous,

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Perspiration</b>, not <i>prespiration</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Persuade.</b> This word carries
with it the idea of success
in one's endeavors to
convince or induce. "I
<i>persuaded</i> him for a long
time, but he would not
grant my request," should
be, "I <i>tried</i> to <i>persuade</i>
him," etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Petrel</b>&mdash;p&#277;t´rel, not p&#275;´trel.

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Plait</b>&mdash;pl&#257;t, not pl&#259;t nor pl&#275;t.
A braid; or to braid. <b>Plat</b>
(pl&#259;t) is a proper word,
however, having the same
meanings, but the difference
in pronunciation must
be observed, when the
spelling is as above. <b>Plait</b>,
meaning a fold of cloth, as
in a shirt bosom, is also
pronounced pl&#257;t. How
common an error it is to

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Prebendary</b>&mdash;pr&#277;b´end-a-ry,

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Raise</b>&mdash;<b>Rise.</b> <i>Raise</i> is a
transitive verb, or one in
which the action passes
over to an object. Present
tense, <i>raise</i>; imperfect tense
and past participle, <i>raised</i>;
present participle, <i>raising</i>.
<i>Rise</i> is an intransitive verb,
the action not passing over
to an object. Present tense,
<i>rise</i>; imperfect tense, <i>rose</i>;
past participle, <i>risen</i>; present
participle, <i>rising</i>. Errors
in the use of these
words ought to be avoided
by remembering the following
rules:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that passes over to an object,
use <i>raise</i>, <i>raised</i>, and
<i>raising</i>.</p>

<p>2. If the person or thing
spoken of exerts an action
that does not pass over to
an object, use <i>rise</i>, <i>rose</i>,
<i>risen</i>, <i>rising</i>. To avoid
further repetition in the
method I have adopted to
impress upon the mind the
difference between transitive
and intransitive verbs
by contrasted sentences, I
would refer the reader to
the remarks under <b>Lay</b>.
"I will <i>raise</i> in the morning
at five," should be, "I
will <i>rise</i>," etc. "I will
<i>raise</i> the <i>window</i>," etc., is
correct, for the action passes
to or affects the window.
"I will <i>raise myself</i>
if I have the strength" is
correct, because an object,
<i>myself</i>, is furnished. "The
price of flour is <i>raising</i>,"
should be, "The price of
flour is <i>rising</i>;" but it is
right to say, "The merchants
are <i>raising</i> the price
of flour." "Gold has
<i>raised</i> in value," should
be, "Gold has <i>risen</i> in
value." "The price of
bonds <i>raised</i> in less than
an hour," should be, "The
price of bonds <i>rose</i>," etc.
"The sun is <i>raising</i>,"
should be, "The sun is
<i>rising</i>." "The sun is
<i>raising</i> the temperature,"
is proper. The pulse has
<i>risen</i>, but excitement has
<i>raised</i> it. The river has
<i>risen</i> in its bed and has
<i>raised</i> the canal. Birds <i>rise</i>
in the air. <i>Arise</i> can often
be appropriately substituted
for <i>rise</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Said.</b> <i>Said</i> (s&#277;d), not says
(s&#277;z), in speaking of past
remarks. Many of the
most cultivated people are
guilty of this vulgarism.
"'I will call to see you
soon,' <i>sez</i> he." "'I will
be glad to see you at any
time,' <i>sez</i> I." Where the
details of a long conversation
are given the frequent
repetition of <i>sez</i>, or even
<i>said</i>, is very grating to the
refined ear. The use of
<i>asked</i>, <i>inquired</i>, <i>remarked</i>,
<i>suggested</i>, <i>answered</i>, <i>replied</i>,
etc., instead, has a pleasing
effect upon narrative
or anecdote. It is preferable,
also, to give the <i>exact</i>
<i>words</i> of the speaker after
<i>said</i>, etc., as: "When he
had finished reading the
letter, he said: 'I will attend
to the business the
first leisure moment I
have.'" When the word
<i>that</i> follows the <i>said</i>, the
substance only of the remark
may be given, as
"He said that he would
attend to the business the
first leisure moment he
had." Whichever form
is used in narrative, it is
not at all harmonious to
give the <i>exact words</i> of one
speaker and only the substance
of the remarks of
another, at least without
regard to regularity in
alternation.</p>

to meet with people that
incorrectly use <i>see</i> in the

him yesterday," instead of,
"I <i>saw</i> him yesterday."

tense but the present, without

loss of the a is not noticed

<b>separation</b>, etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Set.</b> Noun. There are
many who incorrectly use
<i>sett</i> in writing of a <i>set</i> of
dishes, a <i>set</i> of chess-men,
a <i>set</i> of teeth, or of some
other collection of things
of the same kind. A <b>sett</b>
is a piece placed upon the
head of a pile for striking
upon, when the pile can
not be reached by the
weight or hammer.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Set</b>&mdash;<b>Sit.</b> Blunders in the
use of these words are
amongst the most common
we have. <i>Set</i>, as we shall
first consider it, is a transitive
verb, or one in which
the action passes over to an
object. Present tense, <i>set</i>;
imperfect tense and past
participle, <i>set</i>; present participle,
<i>setting</i>. <i>Sit</i> is an
intransitive verb, or one
which has no object after
it. Present tense, <i>sit</i>; imperfect
tense and past participle,
<i>sat</i>; present participle,
<i>sitting</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">To avoid repetition as
much as possible, I would
refer any one to whom the
explanation here given is
not perfectly clear, to the
rules and remarks under
<b>Lay</b> and <b>Raise</b>, which are
equally applicable here.
"Will you <i>set</i> on this
chair?" should be, "Will
you <i>sit</i> on this chair?"
"Will you <i>set</i> this <i>chair</i>
in the other room?" is
correct. "I <i>set</i> for my
picture yesterday," should
be, "I <i>sat</i>," etc. "This
hat <i>sets</i> well," should be,
"This hat <i>sits</i> well."
"Court <i>sets</i> next month,"
should be, "Court <i>sits</i> next
month." "The hen has
been <i>setting</i> for a week,"
should be, "The hen has
been <i>sitting</i>," etc. "As
cross as a <i>setting</i> hen,"
should be, "As cross as a
<i>sitting</i> hen." But a person
may <i>set</i> a hen; that is,
place her in position on
eggs. One <i>sits</i> up in a
chair, but he <i>sets</i> up a
post. One <i>sits</i> down on
the ground, but he <i>sets</i>
down figures. <i>Set</i> is also
an intransitive verb and
has special meanings attached
to it as such, but
they may be readily understood
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
by a little study
of the dictionary, and no
confusion need arise. The
sun <i>sets</i>. Plaster of Paris
<i>sets</i>. A setter dog <i>sets</i>.
One <i>sets</i> out on a journey.
<i>Sit</i> may also be used in
two senses as a transitive
verb, as: "The general
<i>sits</i> his horse well," and
"The woman <i>sat</i> herself
down."</p>

<p>W.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Wake</b>, etc. <i>Wake</i> is both a
transitive and an intransitive
verb. Present tense,
<i>wake</i>; imperfect and past
participle, <i>waked</i>; present
participle, <i>waking</i>. <i>Awake</i>
is also both transitive and
intransitive. Present,
<i>awake</i>; imperfect, <i>awoke</i> or
<i>awaked</i>; participles, <i>awaked</i>
and <i>awaking</i>. <i>Awaken</i> is
another verb, both transitive
and intransitive. Present,
<i>awaken</i>; imperfect and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
past participle, <i>awakened</i>;
present participle, <i>awakening</i>.
Thus it is seen that
we have a great many
words to express the fact
of <i>being</i> in a conscious
state, and the arousing of
a person who is asleep.
With a little attention
there is no reason for committing
an error in the
use of these words. One
may say that he <i>waked</i>,
<i>awoke</i>, or <i>awakened</i> early
in the morning, but it is
wrong to say that he <i>woke</i>
in the morning, or that he
<i>woke</i> another; for there is
no such word as <i>woke</i>. "I
<i>wakened</i> at five o'clock,"
should be, "I <i>awakened</i> at
five o'clock;" for there is
no such word as <i>wakened</i>.
<i>Up</i> is used only with <i>wake</i>,
<i>waked</i> and <i>waking</i>, but
even then it is one of our
most senseless superfluities.
There is no stronger
meaning in the assertion
that a man was <i>waked up</i>,
than that he was <i>waked</i> or
<i>awakened</i>. If <i>waking up</i>
meant to <i>wake</i> and make
<i>get up</i>, it would be different,
but it does not. One
may be <i>waked up</i> and it is
just as likely that he will
go to sleep again as if
he were simply <i>awakened</i>.
<i>Awake</i> and <i>awaken</i> are
more elegant words than
<i>wake</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Wassail</b>&mdash;w&#335;s´s&#301;l, not w&#259;s´s&#301;l.
A festive occasion,
carousal, the song sung at
such a time, etc. The verb
and the adjective are
spelled and pronounced
similarly.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Water</b>&mdash;waw´ter, not w&#335;t´er.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Welsh</b>, not <i>Welch</i>. The latter
word is seldom used.
<b>Welshman</b>, etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Whinny</b>, not <i>winny</i>, when the
cry of a horse is spoken of.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Whisk</b>, not <i>whist</i>, when
a small hand-broom is
meant. <b>Wisp</b>, however,
is a proper word, meaning
the same thing.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Whiting</b> is preferable to
<i>whitening</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em;"><b>Widow.</b> It is not necessary

one will suspect her of

<h2>SCRIPTURAL, MYTHOLOGICAL AND<br />
OTHER PROPER NAMES.</h2>

<p>In the vocabulary just completed, it has been the
design to point out the majority of errors occurring
in the pronunciation of the words usually selected by
people of fair or excellent education to carry on ordinary
English discourse. In the portion of the
work now under consideration, nothing like such
thoroughness is contemplated.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, it will appear to any
one, that to mention the thousands upon thousands
of proper names, the erroneous pronunciation of
which is rather to be expected than the correct,
would require an elaborate volume. Every one who
has striven to become a fine orthoepist has longed
for the ability to comprehend the pronunciation of
that myriad of names, any one of which is apt to
confront him in any book or paper he may chance
to pick up. But to become a proficient in this respect
would require years of study and a knowledge
of the principles of many foreign languages.</p>

<p>Amongst geographical names, for example, who
but the specially instructed would think of pronouncing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
correctly <i>Goes</i> (<span class="smcap">h</span>&#335;&#335;ce), <i>Gelves</i>
(<span class="smcap">h</span>&#277;l´v&#277;s)
or <i>Jalapa</i> (<span class="smcap">h</span>ä-lä´pä); or amongst biographical
names, <i>Gaj</i> (g&#299;), <i>Geel</i> (<span class="smcap">h</span>&#257;l) or <i>Geijer</i> (g&#299;'er).</p>

<p>It is fortunate for the reputation of those who bear
the name of being good scholars, that errors in the
pronunciation of most proper names are excusable,
which is not the case with the mistakes that have
before been laid down. But there are some proper
names, of such constant occurrence in daily lectures,
reading and conversation, that errors connected with
them are not to be overlooked. It is the intention
here, simply to call attention to the more common of
these, and to lead the reader to appreciate the fact
that if one depends upon the usual power of the English
letters to gain a correct pronunciation of
proper names, he will be more often led astray than
otherwise.</p>

<p>The Authorities consulted are the best&mdash;Webster,
Worcester, Lippincott's Universal Pronouncing Dictionary
of Biography and Mythology and Lippincott's
Pronouncing Gazetteer of the World.</p>

<h2>ORTHOEPICAL ERRORS OF THE PROFESSIONS.</h2>

<p>Although errors of speech are at all times to be
deprecated, and are generally criticised without much
leniency, it must be admitted that unless they are
very gross, reasonable excuses are to be taken for
those who have never made their language a subject
of close study, and whose only use of words is entirely
impromptu in the business affairs of life, in
the home circle, or in the social gathering.</p>

<p>Though a person's descent from Belgravia or Billingsgate
is in a great measure revealed by the propriety
of his discourse, yet this refers principally to
those words that are employed by the masses in the
every-day conversations of life, rather than to technicalities
and words related to particular professions,
the use of which is generally confined to the specially
instructed. But when a man stands forth as an
orator, a teacher, a minister, or a professor of some
college, it is certainly not unreasonable for those
that sit under his instruction, to expect and demand
that his speech should be almost free from errors.</p>

<p>One occupying such a position may well be excused
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
for occasional embarrassment, poor voice, unpleasant
address, hesitation of delivery, and various
failings and peculiarities that can not be overcome,
but little or no allowance can be made for constantly
repeated errors.</p>

<p>Probably there has never been a public speaker
so perfect in diction, that he has not in moments of
embarrassment, or when much absorbed in his subject,
been guilty of grammatical inaccuracies or mistakes
of pronunciation; and doubtless he is as often
aware of them as his listeners are, as soon as they
drop from his lips, but it would be foolish to call attention
to them by going back to correct them. But
when these offenses are so glaring and so frequently
repeated that it is evident the speaker knows no better,
it is no wonder that the educated hearer often
thinks that the teacher had better leave his position
and submit to being taught.</p>

<p>What allowance can an intelligent congregation
make for their minister who has nothing else to do
but prepare his sermons, if, besides a multitude of
common English mistakes, he pronounces more than
half of his scriptural names in a manner that is not
sanctioned by any authority?</p>

<p>When the orotund medical professor stands up to
address his students, or to engage in the discussions
of a convention, and rolls out technicality after technicality
pronounced in a manner that would be disowned
by the original Latin or Greek, and is totally
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
at variance with established usage, who would not
ask for a little less elegance and a little more education?
If it required a great amount of labor outside
of the usual course of study for professional men to
acquire a knowledge of the pronunciation of words
peculiar to the professions, the subject might be
treated with more tolerance; but as the definitions
and the orthoepy might be so readily learned together
during those years of daily reference to books that
are required before one should be considered competent
to stand as a guide to others, it certainly seems
that they do not properly appreciate the dignity of
their position by thus laying themselves open to public
criticism.</p>

<p>Many a student, in order to become instructed in
certain branches, has been compelled to reluctantly
sit for months or years at the feet of those that he
felt were far inferior to him in common school education,
hearing hourly such violations of orthoepy
and syntax as would be a discredit to school children.
And, doubtless, many such students have had
such a charity for their teachers that they have
wished to direct their attention to their faults, but
have been restrained on account of the fear of enmity,
expulsion, or of lessening the chances for passing
the final examination.</p>

<p>The bare thought of being so criticised should be
so galling to any one bearing the dignified title of
"professor," that he ought to be stimulated to endeavor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to make himself an authority concerning the
proprieties of speech.</p>

<p>The study of orthoepy was held in such high esteem
by the accent Greeks, and their delicate ears
were so offended by any violation of its rules, that
if an orator mispronounced a single word, the entire
audience immediately hissed him.</p>

<p>During the present state of pronunciation it would
indeed be embarrassing to the public speaker, if such
a custom existed in this country. Let us imagine,
for instance, our friend Professor Abdominous Gynæcophonus,
with his face ebullient with smiles of
self-conceit, arising to address such an audience.
"Gentlemen: I have listened patiently to this op´po-nent
(<i>hisses</i>) of al´lo-path-y (<i>hisses</i>) and now arise
to make a few remarks and in´quir-ies (<i>hisses</i>). In
answer to his objections against hy-os-cy-&#257;´mus
(<i>hisses</i>) as an anodyne and s&#333;´por-if-ic, (<i>hisses</i>) I
would say that in cases of cough and sleeplessness,
I have long used hyoscyamia combined in tr&#333;´ch&#277;z
(<i>hisses</i>) without any of those effects that the p&#259;t´ron
(<i>hisses</i>) of h&#333;´me-o-path-y (<i>hisses</i>) mentions. And
having made almost a specialty of the treatment of
f&#259;ç´i-al (<i>hisses</i>) neuralgia or tic-d&#335;l-o-r&#333;&#333;´" (<i>hisses</i>)&mdash;and
it would certainly be time for him to dolorously
sit down, although he might raise the question&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's in a name? that which we call a rose,</p>
<p>By any other name would smell as sweet,"</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
    and argue therefrom that the pronunciation of a word
should make no difference so long as its meaning was
understood. Amongst professional men, it has been
observed that physicians and dentists are by far more
prone than others to orthoepical errors. Attention
is requested to a few of the more common of these
in addition to those found in the preceding vocabulary
connected with words that are alike used by the
professional and the unprofessional, such as: <i>abdomen</i>,
<i>acclimated</i>, <i>albumen</i>, <i>animalcula arabic</i>, <i>citrate</i>,
<i>embryo</i>, <i>excrescence</i>, <i>fetid</i>, <i>fetor</i>, <i>forceps</i>, <i>homeopathy</i>,
<i>hydropathy</i>, <i>jugular</i>, <i>jujube</i>, <i>nasal</i>, <i>pharmacop&oelig;ia</i>, <i>purulent</i>,
<i>spasmodic</i>, <i>sulphurous</i>, <i>tragacanth</i>, etc. The
authorities appealed to are Dunglison, Thomas, Webster
and Worcester. Notwithstanding the superior
merit of Dunglison's Medical Dictionary, as far as the
comprehensiveness and reliability of its definitions
are concerned, it is evident that it is almost useless
as an orthoepical guide. The principal accent is in
many cases marked, but the pronunciation of preceding
and succeeding syllables can not be determined,
and there is no attempt at syllabication.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas' dictionary, though less comprehensive,
is equally reliable in its definitions, and is excellent
authority in regard to orthoepy; though it
is to be regretted that in some words important syllables
are not sufficiently marked. For instance,
take the words <i>as-bes´tos</i> and <i>bis´muth</i>; how can it
be determined whether the first should be pronounced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
&#259;s-b&#277;s´toss or &#259;z-b&#277;s´t&#333;z or the latter b&#301;z´muth
or b&#301;ss´muth? Webster and Worcester are
undoubtedly good authorities for the pronunciation
of the medical words they give. In the following
vocabulary all of the authorities that mention the
words may be considered as agreeing, unless notice
is made of their disagreement.</p>

<h2>SENTENCES FOR PRACTICE.</h2>

<p>The following extract is from the letter of a friend, to
whom were sent some of the advance pages of this work:
"I am absolutely filled with astonishment to see how many
simple words I have been mispronouncing all my life, and
would have kept on mispronouncing to the end of my days
if my thoughts had not been directed to them. If I were in
your place I would end the book with a story in which all
the words would be used in the course of the narrative. I
can imagine no amusement more instructive or interesting
than for a social party to read in turns, under some penalty
for each mistake."</p>

<p>I had myself conceived the idea of presenting the words
untrammeled with explanation of the orthoepy, or marks of
accent; but the form was not decided upon.</p>

<p>The effort to compose a narrative was abandoned after a
fair trial; for to have a plot and also bring the words in natural
position would require a large volume; otherwise, it
made senseless jumble. In the trial sentences given the objects
are gained in small space. Those objects are to allow
readers to exercise the memory and test their friends; and
at the same time to use the words syntactically. It is hoped
that the reader will pardon any absurdities of context; as
they can not be avoided where one is compelled to use so
many selected words, and is obliged to force them into a
small compass.</p>

<p>I have heard much of the <i>gamins</i> of <i>Gotham</i>, but
I never realized what the <i>gallows</i>-deserving rascals
were till I settled in New York City. I opened business
as a <i>pharmaceutist</i> on a corner that was a favorite
<i>haunt</i> of theirs. Such a crowd of <i>tatterdemalions</i>
as stood in front of my show-window the first
day I made my display of <i>Parisian</i> fancy goods, baffles
description. One had the <i>hooping</i> cough, and
every now and then would hoop till the <i>perspiration</i>
rolled down his face; then he would shriek out the
daily <i>newspapers</i>, in a voice like a <i>calliope</i>. One
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
dirty-faced <i>gourmand</i> ate <i>papaws</i> till he had to <i>gape</i>
for breath, and would shoot the seeds and throw the
skins at his <i>hundred</i> comrades, half of them coming
in my front door. Another, dressed in ragged <i>jean</i>,
his face covered with <i>soot</i>, played the <i>jew's-harp</i> hour
after hour, with as much pride in his ability as <i>Paganini</i>
at his violin. Another, a tall, <i>jaundice</i> visaged
youth with an <i>embryo</i> beard of about a dozen hairs,

<i>surtout</i>, in the <i>lapel</i> of which was pinned a
death's-head, danced upon the iron cellar door till it

pitching <i>quoits</i>, <i>meawing</i> like cats, howling at my
<i>patrons</i> and driving reputable <i>patronage</i> away. Every
now and then they would send in little, <i>saucy</i>, <i>precocious</i>

for two cents' worth of <i>jujube</i> paste, <i>tolu</i> or <i>licorice</i>,

At last, when the sun had reached the <i>horizon</i>, as a

hurled a bowlder through my French plate-glass,

art. Their <i>guardian</i>, himself a great lover of
<i>drama</i>, having foolish confidence in their success,
grants them <i>plenary</i> indulgence in all their whims.
They are <i>habitués</i> of the <i>theatre</i>, and have fitted up
a <i>suite</i> of apartments next to a <i>suit</i> of rooms occupied
by some stock actors, with whom they are bound
in <i>indissoluble</i> bonds of friendship. There they
spend the day in practice, and if you should call at
any hour, there is no telling what will present itself
to you. Perhaps Macbeth with the <i>glamour</i> of his
eyes, viewing the imaginary <i>gouts</i> of blood; or <i>Banquo</i>
with his gory locks; or some knight with his
<i>cuirass</i> on and his <i>visor</i> down, plunging, without a
<i>qualm</i>, his carmine-stained <i>poniard</i> into the <i>jugular</i>
of some <i>patriot</i>. Possibly, Othello the <i>Moor</i>, King
John with the <i>Magna Charta</i>, or a <i>legendary</i> warrior
of frightful <i>mien</i> with his <i>falchion</i> drawn, will admit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
you. Or you may see a <i>viscount</i> with <i>falcon</i>, a <i>rampant</i>
villain, a <i>jocund</i> host, or an <i>irate</i>, <i>splenetic</i> old
man with <i>spectacles</i>, pronouncing with <i>senile vehemence</i>
a curse upon some <i>fragile</i> female in <i>negligee</i>
before him, who beseeches the aid of an <i>immobile
statue</i> in a <i>niche</i> in the wall. You may get there in
the nick of time to save Desdemona by an <i>exposé</i> of
<i>Iago</i>'so villainy, to rescue Pythias whom Damon holds
by the <i>nape</i> of the neck on the <i>threshold</i> of eternity,
or to restrain the <i>suicidal</i> design of the <i>Montague</i> by
informing him that the fair Capulet is only under the
influence of a <i>soporific</i>&mdash;not dead. You may arrive
soon enough to arouse the womanhood in the <i>docile</i>
Kate, making her less <i>docible</i>, and talk woman's
rights to <i>Petruchio</i>, making him more <i>lenient</i>.</p>

<p>And you will find the guardian of these promising
youths, sitting there all day shouting <i>encore</i> to
their absurdities, and not <i>rational</i> enough to see his
<i>indiscretion</i> in permitting their <i>frivolity</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>ennui</i>, recently complained of, was relieved by
an invitation to a party given by the <i>Mesdames</i> B.,
the same you met at the <i>conversazione</i> of the church
<i>guild</i>. The ladies received their guests with their
usual <i>suavity</i>. Their niece, <i>Rosamond</i>, recently from
<i>Madrid</i>, was the attraction of the evening; she wore
an elegant <i>moire</i> antique with a profusion of <i>valenciennes</i>;
she had a beautiful set of jewelry&mdash;<i>opal</i>
and diamonds. It was marvelous how her <i>tiny</i> hands
flew over the <i>piano-forte</i>. She sings very sweetly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
too; her voice is a sort of <i>mezzo-soprano</i>. The
<i>naïve</i> Miss <i>Ursula</i> was present, nearly smothered in
black silk and <i>guipure</i>. She looks much prettier in
<i>dishabille</i>. The little <i>piquant</i> Miss <i>Irene</i>, with her
<i>plaited</i> hair, sang with a voice like a <i>paroquet</i> her
favorite, "<i>Tassels</i> on the Boots." That disgusting
young <i>Leopold</i> was there, feeling as important as a
<i>Rothschild</i>, making his <i>salams</i>, and <i>palavering sotto
voce</i> to all the girls, circulating his <i>monogram</i> cards
and sporting his paste pin with its dazzling <i>facets</i>.
He thinks he cuts a wide <i>swath</i>.</p>

<p>Late in the evening those that were fond of <i>Terpsichorean</i>
amusement were ushered into a room where
the <i>tapestry</i> was covered and there spent several hours
in <i>minuets</i>, waltzes, quadrilles, etc.</p>

<p>The topics of conversation amongst the more sensible
during the evening were the object of the visit
of the new <i>prelate</i>, and the recent speeches of <i>Disraeli</i>
and <i>Thiers</i>.</p>

<p>Madame B. caused a good deal of merriment by
describing an improvement in her <i>cuisine</i> that had

dead. He lived the life of a <i>roué</i> for some years in
Paris and London, and turned out to be a most <i>perfidious</i>
villain. In the latter city he committed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
many <i>heinous</i> offenses and acts of <i>subtle</i> knavery that
were almost without <i>precedent</i>. He was engaged for
a long time in the manufacture of <i>spurious</i> money by
a new <i>process</i>, in which dies were taken from <i>gutta-percha</i>
impressions. He had purchased the services
of an experienced professor of <i>metallurgy</i>, and the
<i>produce</i> of their crime would have been immense, if
some of his other crimes had not been betrayed.
<i>Placards</i>, offering a large reward for his arrest, were
posted all over the city. He fled to Venice where
he was soon afterward drowned by falling from a
<i>gondola</i>, thus cheating the <i>gibbet</i> of its dues.</p>

<h2>VIOLATED RULES OF GRAMMAR.</h2>

<p>Many, who claim to be good grammarians, are occasionally
guilty of the violation of certain important
rules. Attention is solicited to a few of the
more common errors of this nature.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NUMBER.</h3>

<p>Certain compounds change the form of the first
word in pluralizing, as: <i>court-martial</i>, <i>brother-in-law</i>,
<i>sister-in-law</i>. Plural, <i>courts-martial</i>, <i>brothers-in-law</i>,
etc. "John has three brother-in-laws," then, is incorrect.</p>

<p>But <i>tea-spoonful</i>, <i>table-spoonful</i>, <i>cupful</i>, <i>pocketful</i>,
etc., are not considered such compounds; therefore,
"two tea-spoonsful of medicine" and "two-cupsful of
flour," should be, "two tea-spoonfuls of medicine,"
and "two cupfuls of flour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
    When name and title are given, with a numeral
adjective prefixed, the <i>name</i> is pluralized. "Are the
two Misses Wilson at home?" should be, "Are the
two Miss Wilsons at home?" But when the numeral
is omitted the <i>title</i> must be pluralized. "Were
the Dr. Browns there?" should be, "Were the Drs.
Brown there?" The rule has been given that the
<i>name</i> only of married ladies is pluralized, but
there appears to be no reason except that of euphony:
the <i>Mrs. Clarks</i> certainly sounds more agreeably
than the <i>Mistresses Clark</i>. In giving the plural
of such titles as: <i>Hon.</i>, <i>Rev.</i>, <i>Squire</i> and <i>Capt.</i>,
euphony is also often considered; but in such cases
it would doubtless be better to add the numeral, as:
the <i>three Hon. Jacksons</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>EACH OTHER&mdash;ONE ANOTHER.</h3>

<p><i>Each other</i> applies to two; <i>one another</i> to more
than two. "The three witnesses contradicted each
other," and "the two men accused one another," are
incorrect.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NEITHER, NOT&mdash;NOR.</h3>

<p><i>Neither</i> and <i>not</i> are followed by <i>nor</i>, not <i>or</i>.
"Neither James or Charles will come," and "it is
not white or black," are incorrect.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TO BE, UNITING WORDS.</h3>

<p>Words united by <i>to be</i>, referring to the same person,
must be of the same case.</p>

<p>"It is me," "It may have been him," "It could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
not be her," and "It was not them," are not correct:
<i>it</i>, in each of the sentences, is <i>nominative</i> and the
other pronouns should be <i>I</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>she</i> and <i>they</i>. "I
took it to be he," and "I understood it to be they,"
are also wrong; for <i>it</i> is objective in both instances,
and the following pronouns should be <i>him</i> and <i>them</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>THAN, AS.</h3>

<p><i>Than</i> and <i>as</i> implying comparison, have the same
case after as before. "He loses more than me,"
"John knows more than him" and "James is not so
tall as her," should be, "He loses more than I"
(lose), "John knows more than he" (knows) and
"James is not so tall as she" (is tall).</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WHO.</h3>

<p>Errors connected with the use of this word are
very common, even amongst good speakers.</p>

<p>"Who did you see?" "Who do you know?" and
"Who did you hear?" are wrong: <i>whom</i> should be
used, for it is the object of the transitive verbs, <i>see</i>,
<i>know</i> and <i>hear</i>. <i>Who</i> in such sentences as: "Who
are you looking at?" and "Who are you writing
to?" should likewise be changed into <i>whom</i>, for it is
the <i>object</i> of the prepositions <i>at</i> and <i>to</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS.</h3>

<p>Adjectives are often erroneously used for adverbs
in sentences like the following: "This is an uncommon
good portrait," "It is a miserable poor painting.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
"<i>Uncommonly good</i> and <i>miserably poor</i> are
right.</p>

<p>Adverbs are still more commonly used for adjectives.
"Mary looked <i>beautifully</i> at the party," and
"Janauschek looked <i>majestically</i> on the stage," are
incorrect, for it is intended to describe the appearance
of Mary and Janauschek, not their manner of
looking; therefore the adjectives <i>beautiful</i> and <i>majestic</i>
should be used.</p>

<p>When <i>two</i> objects are compared, the <i>comparative</i>
degree should be used. "William is the heaviest of
the two," and "Which is the most desirable&mdash;health
or wealth?" ought to be, "William is the heavier
of the two," and "Which is the more desirable&mdash;health
or wealth?"</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>THESE, THOSE.</h3>

<p>The plural demonstratives <i>these</i> and <i>those</i> are often
erroneously used with singular nouns, as: "I don't
like these kind of people," and "Those sort of
things are very embarrassing." <i>Kind</i> and <i>sort</i> are
singular and should have <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INTO.</h3>

<p><i>Into</i>, not <i>in</i>, is used to show the relation between
verbs expressing motion, entrance, change of state,
etc., and an objective case, as: "Come into the
house," "Step into the carriage," and "Look into
the room."</p>
